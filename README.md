# Dotfiles
My dotfiles/configuration files kept in a tidy repo to sync across devices. Includes:

* .bashrc
* .gitconfig
* .profile
* .vim

## Installation
1. Clone the repo in ~ directory: `git clone https://github.com/turnabout/dotfiles`
2. Rename the cloned directory `dotfiles` into `.dotfiles`
3. Run make.sh to correctly set up symlinks for all files
4. ???
5. Profit!

Also includes a `bin` folder containing executable bash commands, for more funtimes.
