# Dotfiles

My dotfiles/configuration files kept in a tidy repo to sync across devices. Includes:

* .bashrc
* .gitconfig
* .profile
* .tmux.conf
* .vim



## Installation

Clone the repo in ~ directory 

```git clone https://github.com/turnabout/dotfiles```


Rename the cloned directory `dotfiles` into `.dotfiles`

```mv dotfiles .dotfiles```


Run make.sh to correctly set up symlinks for all files

```.dotfiles/make.sh```



Also includes a `bin` folder containing executable bash commands, for more funtimes.
