JustFly new filters

Specs on new JustFly left-hand side filters work. “Inspired” by Cheap-O.


## Left Filters
• “Mixed Airlines” option currently doesn’t actually work as intended.
  When an airline is checked by itself, results will show that airline 
  along with other airlines, so not true exclusivity. It should be.
  
  On top of that, the “Multiple Airlines” option should be checked when 
  showing one airline along with others, contrarily to how it is right now.

• When refining search with left filters, add them over the search results 
  to make it easy to see which filters are selected, and add an option 
  to remove them (Like Cheap-O).

  Additionally, we might want to display the "Show all" option over filters 
  only when filters are actually applied, and not at all times.

• Place alliances filter in their own tab underneath the “Airlines” filter.

• Add “NEW icon next to stops filter (Like Cheap-O).

• Add layovers to airports box

• Add Connection Time filter section (Like Cheap-O).


## Tabs
• Tabs, left filters & matrix should all work together

• Make tabs larger - not obvious enough when they're selected

• Change Direct tab to "Shortest/Direct". It should show all flights ordered 
  by flight duration ascending.


## Interaction Matrix & Left filters:
• Clear matrix selection when: 
  • Selecting left filters for STOPS or AIRLINES
  • Selecting top tabs

• Clear selected left filters when:
  • Matrix is selected (clear any selected STOP or AIRLINE filter)


## Other
• Show number of results (x found)


## Notes/Questions
• Find a way to refresh filters without re-rendering them entirely.

• About that, if we don't re-render the whole markup entirely, we might want 
  to make the filter experience less user-blocking 
  (no full page overlay while the filter is loading)

• When you close the matrix, it's gone for good. Different way?

• In search results, add descriptive text to depart & return times. E.g.
  "Leaving New York" instead of "New York"
