JustFly new filters

Specs on new JustFly left-hand side filters work. “Inspired” by Cheap-O.


## Left Filters
• “Mixed Airlines” option currently doesn’t actually work as intended.
  When an airline is checked by itself, results will show that airline 
  along with other airlines, so not true exclusivity. It should be.
  
  On top of that, the “Multiple Airlines” option should be checked when 
  showing one airline along with others, contrarily to how it is right now.

• When refining search with left filters, add them over the search results 
  to make it easy to see which filters are selected, and add an option 
  to remove them (Like Cheap-O).

  Additionally, we might want to display the "Show all" option over filters 
  only when filters are actually applied, and not at all times.

• Place alliances filter in their own tab underneath the “Airlines” filter.

• Add “NEW icon next to stops filter (Like Cheap-O).

• Add layovers to airports box

• Add Connection Time filter section (Like Cheap-O).


## Tabs
• Tabs, left filters & matrix should all work together

• Make tabs larger - not obvious enough when they're selected

• Change Direct tab to "Shortest/Direct". It should show all flights ordered 
  by flight duration ascending.


## Interaction Matrix & Left filters:
• Clear matrix selection when: 
  • Selecting left filters for STOPS or AIRLINES
  • Selecting top tabs

• Clear selected left filters when:
  • Matrix is selected (clear any selected STOP or AIRLINE filter)


## Other
• Show number of results (x found)

• In search results, add descriptive text to depart & return times. E.g.
  "Leaving New York" instead of "New York"


## Notes/Questions/Suggestions
• Find a way to refresh filters without re-rendering them entirely.

• About that, if we don't re-render the whole markup entirely, we might want 
  to make the filter experience less user-blocking 
  (no full page overlay while the filter is loading)

• When you close the matrix, it's gone for good. Different way?

• We might want to make the left filters collapsable like Cheap-O

• "Show all" button should appear ONLY when a filter has been added

• In the matrix, it's not at all obvious you can click on "All Fares" to 
  filter in all airlines. Since it's an option just like the airlines, it should 
  be visually similar to the airlines.

• Unlike Cheap-O, you can't click on the Stop options in the matrix 
  ("Non-Stop & 1 Stop", "2+ Stops") to filter by them. This funtionality would 
  be easy to add: it should just check/uncheck the corresponding Stop filters.

## Proposal for rework
1. Filters are all globally linked together. I think we should make one big JS 
   module that properly holds the current filter states, and changes to this 
   object are reflected in all concerned filters & parts of the dom 
   independently of where they're located in the page.

   This means we're no longer re-rendering the left-hand filter.
   IMO, this makes it easier to centralize all logic in JS, and make the matrix 
   play nicely with the left filter
   (currently the matrix gets updated via js manually, rather than by having 
   its markup fetched and swapped like the left filter). 
   So it'd be more modulable in the long run.

   So we only render it one time, from the session. 
   Everytime it's changed, we still send an AJAX call to:
   1. Update the user sessions, so when they refresh or come back to the page 
      later, the filters remain the same.
   2. Fetch the search results with the currently applied filters

2. Let's not change the way search results are fetched, at least not yet. It 
   works as-is, and while it's not optimal to fetch the entire HTML and swap 
   the existing one, we're mainly concerned with the filters themselves.

3. I think it would be preferable to write this in pure JS without relying 
   on frameworks, other than maybe jQuery. Mostly to avoid some framework 
   quirk from messing up the search page for old browsers.

I think doing things this way will make it much easier to maintain, add 
new filters, change functionalities, etc. It might be good if left filters & 
the matrix all live under the same umbrella.

### Tests results

iPhone 4S → iOS 5.1:
iPhone 4S → iOS 6.0:
• Core works
• Filters' scroll boxes are messed up, they're much too tall and 
we can't properly scroll through them.
• Connection time → "Show layovers up to ** hours" is incorrectly alligned


iPhone 5  → iOS 6.0:
• Same as above. Slightly easier to scroll through filters but still horrendously spaced.


iPad 2   → iOS 5.0:
iPad 3rd → iOS 5.1:
• Same as above. Sometimes the filters don't appear at all. 
  Or it seems they take a really long time to appear after clicking their tab.
  The same goes for the two other tabs (Search & Alerts)


iPad 2 → iOS 4.3:
• Core doesn't work. Loader is a square. Various other CSS issues.


iPad Mini → iOS 7.0:
• Core works
• Doesn't take forever to open filters & Search/Alerts
• Filters still horrendously spaced


iPhone 5S → iOS 7.0 → Safari:
iPhone 5S → iOS 7.0 → Chrome:
• Core works
• Scroll is weird. Is it just the emulator (Browserstack)?
• Filters pop-up correctly and work, but still horrendously spaced.

iPhone 6S Plus → iOS 9 → Safari:
• Core works (obviously)
• Still has the same scroll issue as all other iOS browsers


Google Nexus 7 → Android 6 → Chrome:
• Core works
• Everything works, save for the times sliders that don't seem to respond to sliding.

Samsung Galaxy S3 → Android 4.1 → Android Browser:
• Core works
• Can't test beyond that, it's too damn slow

Samsung Galaxy S2 → Android 2.3 → Android Browser:
• Core doesn't work

Nokia 520 → Windows Phone 8.1:
Nokia 920 → Windows Phone 8.1:
• Core works
• Everything works, surprisingly

Android < 4.1

IE < 9
Safari < 5.1
Firefox < 20
Opera < 12.12 (Yes, 12.12 specifically)

Chrome < Who knows? Version 15 works, nothing lower in Browserstack
```

### Issues
