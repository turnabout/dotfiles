C Unsigned Integer Becomes Signed in printf

The `printf` function, when using a `%d` format, 
requires a **signed** integer `int` argument.

Meaning, if the given integer is unsigned, it will 
be printed as if it were signed, because it will 
get casted as a signed integer when passed to the 
`printf` function.

## Example
```
   unsigned int u = 5;
   
   u = u - 10;

   printf(“%d”, u); /* -5 */
   printf(“%u”, u); /* 4 294 967 291 */
```
